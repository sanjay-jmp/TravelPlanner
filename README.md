# TravelPlanner

TravelPlanner is a web app that helps users create personalized travel itineraries based on their preferred locations and attractions. It uses AI-powered suggestions from the Hugging Face API to generate day-wise travel plans tailored to user preferences.

## Features

- Input preferred locations and attractions  
- Specify number of travel days  
- Receive AI-generated itineraries formatted in markdown  
- Powered by the Mistral AI model from Hugging Face

- **Backend:** None â€” calls Hugging Face API directly from frontend
